# Some Storms, a poem for bpNichol
Python code for "Some Storms," a generative weather poem.

## From the title screen:

In 1984, poet bpNichol released one of the first widely-distributed "computer poems," entitled "First Screening." These concrete poems, influenced by other such as Apollinaire's "Il Pleut" could not have anticipated the on-coming age of big data. This poem leverages weather data for the zip code 22030 for the first 11 months of 2016. Rain and snow accumulates on the screen in direct proportion to the amount of rain/snowfall received on the day indicated in the upper left on the statistical readout.

Leverages curses, yaml, and data from [WeatherUnderground](https://www.wunderground.com/history/). Can be used for any duration of time, any locationâ€”as long as the data is formatted as a YAML file.
